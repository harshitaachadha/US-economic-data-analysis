The jupiter file shows basic level python code that is used to analyse US gross GDP and unemployment data for the past 80 years.
The use of pandas and bokeh.plotting libraries has been demonstrated clearly and the concept of dataframes is utlised accordingly.

Understanding and analyzing US economic data is vital for informed decision-making. Here, we explore how Python and IBM Cloud Object Storage can be used to retrieve, analyze, and visualize US economic data related to GDP change and unemployment. By leveraging these tools, we can gain valuable insights into economic trends and their impact on various sectors.

The provided code retrieves 'gdp.csv' and 'employment.csv' files from IBM Cloud Object Storage, representing US economic data. Using pandas, the code reads the data into separate DataFrames and filters the employment data to identify periods of high unemployment. The code then utilizes the Bokeh library to create an interactive dashboard, visualizing GDP change and unemployment over time. This interactive visualization enables users to explore the data and draw meaningful conclusions about the relationship between these economic indicators.

By employing Python and cloud-based storage solutions, we can efficiently analyze and interpret large datasets, empowering policymakers, researchers, and businesses to make data-driven decisions.
